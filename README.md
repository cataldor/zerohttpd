# zerohttpd

This is a re-write of the ZeroHTTPd project from shuveb [1]. More information
is available here [2].

The main objectives are:

* Reuse code as much as possible. shuveb's code copies the same code for each
  architecture;
* `style(9)` coding style.

# Notes

This is a work-in-progress, guestpage is not working.
